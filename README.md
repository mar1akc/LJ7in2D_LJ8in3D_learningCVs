**Jiaxin Yuan, Shashank Sule, Yeuk Yin Lam, and Maria Cameron, "Learning collective variables that respect permutational symmetry". ArXiv:<TBA>.**

This package is designed for computing the free energy and diffusion matrix with respect to the standard and given machine-learned collective variables for two systems: Lennard-Jones-7 in 2D and Lennard-Jones-8 in 3D. The machine-learned collective variables are obtained by Algorithm 1 in the paper above implemented in the codes in the GitHub Repository

Furthermore, it offers codes  forward flux sampling, generating transition trajectories using stochastic control, brute force sampling.
