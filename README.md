# LJ7in2D_LJ8in3D_learningCVs
This package contains a collection of C codes for computing the free energy and diffusion matrix with respect to the standard and machine-learned collective variables for two systems: Lennard-Jones-7 in 2D and Lennard-Jones-8 in 3D. Furthermore, it offers codes  forward flux sampling, generating transition trajectories using stochastic control, brute force sampling.
