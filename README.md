This package contains a collection of C codes for the paper

Jiaxin Yuan, Shashank Sule, Yeuk Yin Lam, and Maria Cameron, *"Learning collective variables that respect permutational symmetry".* ArXiv:<TBA>.

This package is designed for computing the free energy and diffusion matrix with respect to the standard and given machine-learned collective variables for two systems: Lennard-Jones-7 in 2D and Lennard-Jones-8 in 3D. The machine-learned collective variables are obtained by Algorithm 1 in the paper above implemented in the codes in the GitHub Repository

[https://github.com/margotyjx/OrthogonalityCVLearning](https://github.com/margotyjx/OrthogonalityCVLearning)

Furthermore, this package offers C codes for forward flux sampling, generating transition trajectories using stochastic control, brute force sampling. 

The directories LJ7in2D and LJ8in3D contain the collections of codes for the respective systems. The subdirectories of these two main directories contain codes for different collective variables.
